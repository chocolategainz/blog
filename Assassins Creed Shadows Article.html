<!--Paragraph 1-->
<p class = "container">
<p class = "p1"> Currently, on YouTube, a quick look at the like-to-dislike ratio of the official trailer for Assassin's Creed: Shadows shows that although 14k people liked the trailer, 36k people disliked it. That is almost three times the number of likes on one video. Curiously, I looked at the comment section of the video and read comments such as, "No gameplay shown but already accepting preorders? You guys have some balls!" and my personal favorite, "Where's the $400 premium legendary edition with 2 new outfits and 19 trailing mission DLCs? " (that one almost made me spit out my coffee). As I continued to scroll down, I saw another comment that stood out to me the most: "There was a black guy once in Japan. Ubisoft: 'OMG.'" Immediately, I began to question the reasoning behind such an extraneous statement. However, as I dug deeper into social media, I discovered that this was a complaint shared by many people. Why does it matter if the main protagonist is black? And why does it matter if the game focuses on the first black samurai in Japan?</p> 
<br>

<!--Paragraph 2-->
<p class = "p2">Yasuke did exist. According to Serge Bile, it was recorded that the first black samurai existed almost 500 years ago, between 1579 and 1582, in Japan. This title was bestowed on him by Oda Nobunaga, one of the most influential Japanese leaders of the 16th century. Oda Nobunaga was a powerful leader who strived to unify Japan during the era known as the Age of Warring States. The title and status of samurai were officially given to Yasuke by Nobunaga, who valued him so much that they fought alongside each other until his death in 1582. According to an article from the National Geographic Channel, author Parissa Djanga explains that even though Yasuke did not go through the traditional means of becoming a samurai, he displayed such loyalty that he was lavished with honorary gifts worthy of a samurai. In fact, as Yasuke served under Nobunaga as a samurai, he was gifted a sword, a house, and a salary, benefits given to all samurais during the 16th century. In this way, it is clear that Yasuke is a well-recognized figure in Japanese history and culture.</p>

<!--Paragraph 3-->
<p class = "p3">Additionally, Assassin's Creed is a video game franchise that is based on historical fiction. This means that the setting or context is real, but fictional elements are added to the plot to make the story sound more interesting. For instance, Assassin's Creed Syndicate had fictional elements in the story by literally having the plot revolve around retrieving the Piece of Eden, a device that can control human behavior. Furthermore, I believe that a game which includes fictional elements in its historical retelling does not deserve to face so much backlash. As I was speaking to my friend about this controversy, he argued that people are rightly upset because the inclusion of a black slave who was not actually a samurai disrespects the history and culture of Japan. However, Yasuke was a warrior of great mystery. All we know of his origin is that he arrived in Japan one day with an Italian Jesuit, and as Nobunaga conversed with Yasuke, he immediately liked him and took him under his wing. According to Ubisoft, since not much is known about Yasuke, Ubisoft developers thought it would be perfect to include him as a playable character because they could fill in their own gaps regarding his origin, character, and status.</p> 
<br>  
<!--Conclusion-->

<p class = "conclusion">Whether people like it or not, Yasuke is a real character and a legendary figure in Japanese culture. So, let Ubisoft tell the story that they feel is right for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
